      text: `
        <p>
          I'm primarily an iOS application developer. I first learned Objective-C and then
          switched to Swift when Apple released it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's make things clear: I know JavaScript but when it comes to mobile application, I
          believe in the superiority of native languages like Swift and Kotlin. That's why I
          recommend my client to go for native technologies rather than hybrid languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really love this language (Swift) which was build on the best of python, C/C++ and
          JavaScript with all the Objective-C legacy. It is so great that I decided to learn it
          as a backend language too.

          <strong>I have been designing, coding and maintaining applications using JavaScript since 2015</strong> and the ES6

          and larger cloud native applications that need to scale up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that JavaScript is the language that can suit most of the issues my client
          are facing. That's why I learnt and tried to master it either on the frontend and
          the backend side of things.
