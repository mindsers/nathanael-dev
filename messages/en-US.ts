        <p>
          I'm primarily an iOS application developer. I first learned Objective-C and then
          switched to Swift when Apple released it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's make things clear: I know JavaScript but when it comes to mobile application, I
          believe in the superiority of native languages like Swift and Java. That's why I
          recommend my client to go for native technologies rather than hybrid languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really love this language (Swift) which was build on the best of python, C/C++ and
          JavaScript with all the Objective-C legacy. It is so great that I decided to learn it
          as a backend language too.

        <p>
          I design, code and maintain applications using JavaScript since 2015 and the ES6
          tsunami in the JavaScript world. I'm used to work on small app using VanillaJS
          and larger cloud native application that need to scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that JavaScript is the language who can suit most of the issue my client
          enconter. That's why I learnt and tried to master it either on the frontend and
          the backend side of things.
