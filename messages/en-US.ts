          My story with code started in 2005. Since then, I have navigated between back and front, web and mobile, desktop and embedded according to my personal and professional projects.

        <p>
          I chose during my professional career to specialize in Swift and JavaScript languages.

          I am now a <strong>Senior lead freelance developer</strong> with over 7 years of professional experience with JavaScript and Swift.
